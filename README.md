# Worlds Between Worlds App Deletion Instructions

1. While in-game, please press the Settings button in the top left corner of the screen. (You may have to play through a few minutes of the game before this becomes visible)
2. This will bring up the Support screen. You should see a "Playfab ID" appear here (it will be a combination of numbers and capitalized letters)
3. Send an e-mail to hello@worldsbetweenworlds.com with the subject line "Data Deletion Request". Please include your Playfab ID in the e-mail

When you have sent your e-mail with your Playfab ID, we will delete your data off our systems!

Thanks!
